## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/tommysteryy/Vertebral_Analysis/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Just wanted to try this, now see if it will work.

Also, what about this:
```R
library(tidyverse)
write_csv()
```
