# Project: Vertebral Column Data Analysis
## Completed Dec 2019, with Yuru Liu and Trinh Nguyen z
Data source: *UCI Machine Learning Repository*  || **Primary Analysis: K-nn Classification with R**

As a former kinesiology student, I deeply value studying the health of the human spine. The spine carries almost all nerves in our body, not only acting as the primary messenger channel between the brain and our body, but also a crucial component of our posture and stance. Vertebral disorders are common to citizens worldwide, including common examples like hernias, scoliosis, or lower-back pain. However, diagnosis of many vertebral disorders are difficult due to fully accessing the body region as well as the large subjectivity in pain perception. This analysis utilizes various *physiological measurements* of the vertebral column to experiment with objective and data-driven approaches to medical diagnosis.

### Project Outline:
1. Reading, tidying, and scaling data
2. Partitioning training and testing data
3. Preliminary data visualization
4. K-NN classification & troubleshooting
5. Testing the model
6. Implications & closing
